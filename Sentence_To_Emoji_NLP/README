The "glove.6B.50d.txt" dataset was used for this project.
GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. 
Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations 
showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.

Apart from this, a pre coded python file was used to carry out word to vector mappings and vice versa.
It also consisted of functions for one hot vector conversions etc.

An accuracy of 100% was obtained on the training set and a validation accuracy of 91% was obtained.
At the end of the program, a few random examples are tried to highlight that this model is still not good enough 
with complex sentences as it does not make use of LSTMs.
This is a very basic project and can be further enhanced to make use of more than just the five emojis that were used
and return better, more accurate predictions.
