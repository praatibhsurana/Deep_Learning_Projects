A model made to make 10 different image classifications.Data from the CIFAR-10 dataset was used. A validation accuracy of about 88% 
was obtained after running for 10 epochs. Accuracy can be further increased if the number of epochs are increased.Pre-trained weights
(Adam optimizer) were used and there was no transfer learning.Low quality images of 32X32 dimensions were used.
